## CertMgr
Create and manage X.509 certificates.

### About CertMgr
The Certificate Manager application supports the creation and management of X.509 certificates and their corresponding objects.
![store view](docs/certmgr1.png)
Certificates are organized in so called Certificate store. Such a store is actually a simple directory structure containing the individual certificate files.

The application supports the following certificate operations:
 * Creation and management of **private certificates** (signed by your own Certificate Authority)
 * Creation and management of **public certificates** (signed by an external Certificate Authority)
 * Creation and management of **Certificate Revocation Lists** (CRL)
 * **Import and export** of certificates (in PEM, DER, PKCS#12 as well as JKS format)
